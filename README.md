# tcgui

A lightweight Python-based Web-GUI for Linux traffic control (`tc`) to set, view and delete traffic shaping rules. The Web-GUI is intended for short-term isolated testbeds or classroom scenarios and does not contain any security mechanisms.

No further changes are planned right now, but pull requests are welcome.
